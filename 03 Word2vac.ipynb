    "## 📌 What are Word Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Word Embeddings** are a technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that **converts words into numerical vectors**, so that words with **similar meanings** have **similar vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧍 Humans understand words by their meaning.  \n",
    "🤖 Computers only understand numbers.  \n",
    "✅ So, **word embeddings help machines understand language** by turning words into **meaningful numbers**.\n",

    "# 🧠 Full Detailed Definition of Word Embeddings (Easy + In-Depth):\n",
    "Word Embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have similar numerical representations (vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), word embeddings are used to transform words into dense vectors of real numbers, where the position of each word in the vector space is learned from a large amount of text. The idea is to capture the meaning of words, their syntactic roles, and their semantic relationships with other words.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**king - man + woman ≈ queen**\n",
